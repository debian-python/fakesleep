Package: python-fakesleep
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: Fake version of time.sleep() for use in tests
 The fakesleep module helps testing code that use `time.sleep()`. Sleeping in
 tests is generally considered bad (as it makes tests run slow). Using
 sleep with `time.time()` can lead to spurious failures, as clock
 precision / interpreter overhead can cause small differences in reported
 times.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.
